# Report for ForestQuery into Global Deforestation, 1990 to 2016 

ForestQuery is on a mission to combat deforestation around the world and to raise awareness about this topic and its impact on the environment. The data analysis team at ForestQuery has obtained data from the World Bank that includes forest area and total land area by country and year from 1990 to 2016, as well as a table of countries and the regions to which they belong.
The data analysis team has used SQL to bring these tables together and to query them in an effort to find areas of concern as well as areas that present an opportunity to learn from successes.

## 1. GLOBAL SITUATION
According to the World Bank, the total forest area of the world was 4,282,694.9 square km in 1990. As of 2016, the most recent year for which data was available, that number had fallen to 39,958,245.9, a loss of 1,324,449 square km or 3.21%.
The forest area lost over this time period is slightly more than the entire land area of Peru listed for the year 2016 (which is 1,279,999.9 square km).

## 2. REGIONAL OUTLOOK 
In 2016, the percent of the total land area of the world designated as forest was 3.38%. The region with the highest relative forestation was Latin America & Caribbean, with 46.16%, and the region with the lowest relative forestation was Middle East & North Africa, with _2.07% forestation.
In 1990, the percent of the total land area of the world designated as forest was 32.42. The region with the highest relative forestation was Latin America & Caribbean, with 51.03%, and the region with the lowest relative forestation was Middle East & North Africa, with 1.78% forestation.
